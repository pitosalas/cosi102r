# Notes 2021

* More chances to share prod with other teams. Students want feedback on their ideas from peers
* Think of something that will kill your idea immediately
* Not sure while we are using gradescope -- no notification
* Cross post assignments in Latte
* Reading of case studies
* More speakers
* Likes the interactivity
* Out of the building "simulations" with students pretending to be customers and then coaching
* How do you write a good hypothesis?
* Do simulations of interviews
* Or even of a focus group
* What does a good or bad hypothesis look like?
* Show examples of well and not well worded hypotheses
* And those that can be easily tested and those that cannot
* Introduce the diff kinds of MVPs gradually not all at once and too early
* Have a presentation mid semester

## SKip
* IP
* Shorten elevator pitch lecture - merge into presentations lecture
* Excel Lecture or assignment -0 don't need both

* Jeffrey: "Only critical feedback would be to spend more time in advance on their financials - key assumptions, modeling their revenue/expense growth and capital to get to their first milestone. The ’shark-tank’ i’m raising $100k and will sell you 10% of the company is just not how it works in the real world, as you know. Also, being more realistic about how they will get their first customers/users and the cost of customer acquisition. "
* Slow down the reading of the chapters and explain one or two key concepts from each chapter just as they read them
* Steve: +1 Jeffrey's feedback below - a little more time spent on the "numbers" portion of the pitch - high-level financials, key assumptions re unit economics (per customer revenues and costs), crude market size/penetration, etc. and I agree setting a "first milestone target" to achieve seed or pre-seed funding is a great way for them to frame it up. Understanding of course that this is an undergrad course ... but just something to help them contextualize the business model with the fundraising! I also found the teams that presented a slide on how the company would attain revenue (e.g. "the school pays $x/student/month") showed additional thoughtfulness even if the model were challenging in reality. And for students who went with basic B2C models around subscription or transaction fees, I found it helpful when they talked about a competitor or complementary product or service that had a similar model - this supports the feasibility. And for those that won't make any money in the short term, that "first milestone target" is even more critical to showing how growth would theoretically create revenue options down the road :)
