<%= homework_hdr %>

1.  <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Read:** "Lean Startup Chapter 6". Think about the following warmup questions as you read the chapter:
    * Sometimes customers get a product that's imperfect, incomplete. When might this happen? . Is that a good or bad thing? What's the purpose for doing this?
    * It's been said (by me among others) that an MVP is neither minimum, viable nor a product. Can you explain why that might be a valid statement, or not?
    * How can you do an MVP of a hardware product? After all, a hardware product by definition has to be manufactured and that is never cheap.
    * What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!
    * <%= deliverable "Submit your responses to the warmup questions as a pdf in Latte" %>
1. <%= partbadge %> **Term Project:** Write up at least one product idea that you MIGHT want to work on. You can build on everything everyone has submitted so far, or offer something brand new. Submit the writeup (less than 1 page) and also add a brief description to the [List of Term Project Ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSHzvyeIp9hIP1zPWa0jjGqpes4kw9GEkLeDcgF48Xs/edit). You can use any idea, from brainstorming so far, from your own discussions, or from anywhere at all. <%= deliverable "Submit your own idea writeup as a pdf. Add a very brief description to the overall lsit as well." %>

## Interesting (optional) reading
* The term MVP was defined (for this specific context) several years ago by Eric Ries. It has always been a bit of a problem because people starting "misusing" it, to mean, "beta" or "early release". Another book i really like has their own refinement of the term: [What's an MVP?](http://ask.leanstack.com/lean-startup-fundamentals/what-is-a-minimum-viable-product-mvp)
* This [MVP Guide](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html) has a good video if you want to review things from a different angle. It's by Eric Ries himself.

## Discussion
* Discussion of Chapter 6, what's an MVP, why do we need one.
  * "An MVP is the earliest usable version of your product. Kind of like a beta test or a preview of the product": True or False?
  * Name some challenges with creating an MVP. How can things go wrong?
  * "The only way to do an MVP for a hardware product is with a prototype": True or False
  * Let's name the different kinds of MVPs we can imagine
* Each Pilot team gives an update of where they are at
  * What is your concept of the Pilot Product
  * Have you gone out of the building?
  * Pick a leader and have them stand up and give 2-3 bullets of status
  * Each Pilot Project Team gives an update of where they are

##  Term Projects Brainstorm

Towards the end of September, we will begin working on the term projects. Between now and then we will be coming up with ideas, writing them up, etc.

<%= callout("right now", " Second round of brainstorming on possible term projects. Collect them on whiteboard and write them down.") %>

* Review and reference: <%= link_to_topic :mvp %>

* Let's talk over students' ideas so far for term products.
  * Ask: Will it make money?
  * Ask: What are key hypotheses?

## Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
