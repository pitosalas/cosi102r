1. **Reading and watching**:  Please prepare for today's guest lecture by looking at [Game Changing Business Models](https://underscore.vc/guidebook/game-changing-business-models/) and reading this article written by Mr. Skok: [Innovation in Startup Business Models](https://xconomy.com/boston/2012/04/05/innovation-in-startup-business-models/)

### Continuing work
* **Continue to work on Stage 2**: Will be due on November 14. Decide on and do more out of the building testing: survey, 1-1 interview, landing page, anything else you can think of. Make sure you know and indicate what the hypotheses were that you were testing as well as the methodology and results of the test. Record your work and the results. Remember we are looking for non-trivial amount of outside testing. You will need it for your term report.
