## Judging

Dear Friends,

It’s that time of year again when my course in Software Entrepreneurship at Brandeis puts on the “Project Showcase”. I am writing to invite you to be a judge on our Software Entrepreneurship Showcase day.

When: December 14th, Wednesday, between 6pm and 8:30pm
Where: Brandeis University Campus in Waltham, Classroom Gerstenzang 124

Spend a couple of fun hours getting pitched by students and giving them real time feedback (as well as a slice of the $3,000,000 in fake money that we divvy up among the products.) Below I will give you more background. It’s a fun way to see what students are learning and how, and perhaps seeing someone you’d like to get to know better or even hire. Also the other panelists are cool people you might want to connect with! Please let me know if you have any questions and whether you’d be willing to volunteer some of your time.

Please let me know asap if you are available (or not) and can serve as a judge. I am looking for four panelists. Thanks so much for considering it!

Quick background: I’ve been teaching this course for the last three years to both Computer Science and non- students, undergrads and grads. The course is roughly structured around the book “The Lean Startup” and is coupled with a project where students form teams of 4 students to develop an idea into a well reasoned product and project pitch.

At the end of the semester we put on a product showcase, where the eight projects put together an 8 minute presentation about the results of their entrepreneurial project, where they describe the product or business, the “out of the building” research they did to validate the product market fit, the feature set and user interface design, the business model and so on.

Thanks for being guest lecturers this semester. As we discussed, I would love to have you come back and see how it all worked out and be a judge for our final Showcase. 

Date and Time: Wednesday December 14th, at 1:30pm to around 4pm
Location: Brandeis University, Waltham, Building Gerstenzang Room 124

As the “final exam” of the course we have a showcase (which we cutely call "Friendly Shark Tank") where each student team presents and demos what their product and business idea. Being a judge is really easy! In previous years the feedback that I've gotten is that it was a lot of fun and rewarding and very little effort. Certainly no preparation would be needed, just simply your knowledge and experience! And you get to see some of your old friends :) 

I would really love to have you guys, but I know it’s holiday season and everyone is super busy. Let me know as soon as you can? Thanks,
