## Questions about non-profits

* "How would you suggest going about starting a non-profit organization?
* "As an example, one that would work to provide funding and equipment to those in need?"
* "What is the analog to a "business model" in a non-profit?" After all we are not optimizing profit, are we?
* "What is the equivalent product/market fit in the world of non-profits?"
* "Would the "learn startup" approach apply to a non-profit?
