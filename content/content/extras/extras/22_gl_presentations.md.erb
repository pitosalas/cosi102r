1. <%= pdfbadge %>  <%= partbadge %> **Reflection:** You can find the [materials for this homework](https://humongousmedia.wistia.com/projects/xq65uh7xek) here. Please take a look at the "HM Preso”  powerpoint deck (also provided in pdf for those without ppt).  During the class, I will briefly present it and ask for feedback both on the slides and my delivery. Please also take a look at the 2 very short videos.  During the class, we will discuss what are the similarities and differences between powerpoint presentations and video presentations. Answer these questions:
  * What is the best presentation you’ve ever seen (Ted talks, Brandeis lectures, lockeroom speech, political debate, etc)? What made it good?
  * What is the worst presentation you’ve ever seen ? What made it bad? If you were going to give a presentation to the class, what “persona” would you adopt (funny, satirical, professorial, friendly, etc)?
  * What are the steps that you go through to create a great presentation?
  * On a scale of 1-100, how terrified are you to present publicly?
  * Which audiences are the most terrifying?
  * How do you see presentations evolving in the coming years?
  * <%= deliverable "A brief writeup of your answer to these questions (1/2 page)" %>
