1. From Jeffrey Beir: View this video: http://mjskok.com/resource/funding-strategies-to-go-distance.  I wonâ€™t cover all this financing strategy in this, but will focus more on how to think about milestones, capital and proof. <%= deliverable "Do warmup questions for today's reading" %>
1. From Jeffrey Beir: Many of you have paired up with another student on a prospective term project. Some of you should have done that, even without a pair, on your own. We will continue discussing those more on Thursday. Thinking of the project you are currently considering, and in discussion with your pair (if you have one), and answer these questions: 1) How would you define success at your first milestone? 2) How will you measure that success, e.g. which independent metrics will you show? <%= deliverable "Post your answer to those questions. Make sure you include the name of the product you are talking about and a very brief description. Without that it is impossible to understand your success metrics!" %>
