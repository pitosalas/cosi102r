### Purpose
* Team collaboration always build effectiveness
* By thinking about these questions you will get a better understanding of your product or service
* And may see things to change and improve that have nothing to do with growth
* Get the team thinking carefully about their product and how they will get it to build up in numbers of users

### Activities
 
<slide_break></slide_break>

* We break out into teams
* Discuss all the ways in which you might achieve growth in your product or service
* Come up with a primary and secondary engine of growth
* Consider how you would get from 0 to 100, 100 to 1,000, 1,000 to 10,000
* Would you use the same engine of growth (which is fine but not required)
* Prepare your submission as follows:
    * 0 - 100: Paid Engine of Growth. We would stand on the sidewalk and offer $100 to every person who would be willing to use our product and tell their friends. 
    * 100 - 1000: Viral Engine of Growth. Our product almost compels users to recruit new users because x and y and z
    * 1000 - 10,000: Viral Engine of Growth continues as above
