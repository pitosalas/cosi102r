* In class activities
* Review: Hypotheses
  * Don't need one from each category
  * Go for quality not quantity
  * Its not a hypothesis if you don't know exactly how to test it
* Review: Landing page as MVP
  * Why is it called a landing page?
  * What is the hypothesis?
  * How will you get people to see it?
  * How will you determine if the hypothesis is borne out?
* Volunteers show off their two screen samples and we discuss and give feedback.
