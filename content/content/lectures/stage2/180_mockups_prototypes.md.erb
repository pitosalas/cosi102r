* In class activities
* Review: Hypotheses
  * Don't need one from each category
  * Go for quality not quantity
  * Its not a hypothesis if you don't know exactly how to test it
* Review: Landing page as MVP
  * Why is it called a landing page?
  * What is the hypothesis?
  * How will you get people to see it?
  * How will you determine if the hypothesis is borne out?

## Conclusion

* I want you to always refer back to principles such as these when you design or present a user experience.
* It's very easy to say, "Oh it's common sense." But you submit designs that violate these principles left and right.
* It's important. Make it part of your toolkit. Internalize it! Take care!
