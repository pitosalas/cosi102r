### A little more practice

<%= callout("pitch", " B2B Tours is a two sided market place, connecting individual tour guides with travelers seeking a tourguide. It increases access to great and novel tourguides, while opening up the market to those tourguides to a totally new set of clients.") %>

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Let's explore these questions:

* What are the personas? How many are there?
* If I am the end user whats the first thing I want to see?
* What are the actions I need from that state?
* Etc.

## Conclusion

* I want you to always refer back to principles such as these when you design or present a user experience.
* It's very easy to say, "Oh it's common sense." But you submit designs that violate these principles left and right.
* It's important. Make it part of your toolkit. Internalize it! Take care!

## Quick review: Creating an MVP / Prototyping / Mockups

* Reminder: <%= link_to_topic :mvp %>
* Compare terms: MVP vs. prototype vs. mockup
* You need to be able to articulate exactly why you are creating a prototype
* Looks like vs. Works like
* Purpose of prototype dictates the medium and fidelity
