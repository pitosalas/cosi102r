## Affordances
  * Why is the notion of affordinaces important?
  * Let's look at some of the pictures that you submitted

## Conclusion

* I want you to always refer back to principles such as these when you design or present a user experience.
* It's very easy to say, "Oh it's common sense." But you submit designs that violate these principles left and right.
* It's important. Make it part of your toolkit. Internalize it! Take care!
## Creating an MVP / Prototyping / Mockups
* Reminder: <%= link_to_topic :mvp %>
* Compare terms: MVP vs. prototype vs. mockup
* You need to be able to articulate exactly why you are creating a prototype
* Looks like vs. Works like
* Purpose of prototype dictates the medium and fidelity

### Making a User Experience flow diagram: P2P Tours
* Let's start with B2BTours, using this description:

<%= callout("pitch", " B2B Tours is a two sided market place, connecting individual tour guides with travelers seeking a tourguide. It increases access to great and novel tourguides, while opening up the market to those tourguides to a totally new set of clients.") %>

* Let's explore these questions:
  * What are the personas? How many are there?
  * If I am the end user whats the first thing I want to see?
  * What are the actions I need from that state?
  * Etc.
