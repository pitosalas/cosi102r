### Team Breakouts (if time allows)

* Break out by teams
* Given your current (not Stage 1) product
* Considering all this
* Name at least 5 metrics for your product
* For each:
    1. Name (e.g. "Successful Registration")
    1. What it measures (e.g. "Percent of users who attempt to register succeed at it")
    1. How you would measure it (e.g. "Count number of users who start to register, and the number who confirm registration")
    1. What you could do about it to improve it ("Look at the instructions or complexity of registration process")
* Each team write up notes as a [Participation post](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=392069)
