:slide_bigtitle MVP Example and practice

### Purpose

* Modeling how to conduct an out of the building MVP
* Also how to empathize with the potential user's perspectives

:slide_title Activity

* How would be test this product? :topic_link :bodega2
* Example: Going out of the building to talk to a shop owner
* What are some hypotheses that you could test with that?
* What do you think a shop owner asks themselves before adopting your product or service?
* Think about this for a little while, write some answers for yourself

:slide_bigtitle Kicking off Term projects

:slide_title Ideas are cheap.

* Whether you wrote up the idea or thought up the idea or love the idea, remember the idea is 0.1% of the journey.
* The idea as written up is just a jumping off point.
* Based on the team and going out of the building, you will adjust it a little or a lot even.

:slide_title All team members have an equal voice

:slide_title Alignment

* This is  very important concept.
* I will harp on it a lot.
* Work to the point where each team member would explain the product in the same way, as the same thing
* This can only come through discussion, writing things down, being open to new ideas and flexible to adjust your ideas.
* The only thing that makes an idea "the best" or "right" is what customers, users, people are willing to adopt.
