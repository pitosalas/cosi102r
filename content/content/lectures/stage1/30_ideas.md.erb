## Key Take Aways from The Lean Startup (ch 1,2,3)

* Build-measure-Learn: Always iterate, learn from information you gather; apply the learnings and go again
* Validated Learning: Learning with empirical evidence in support of conclusions (learnings)
* Make sure you know who really needs what you are creating
* The question is not: "Can this product be built?" but "Should this product be built?" and "Can we build a sustainable business around this product?

## Team Breakouts

* Each student on the team briefly presents their business or product ideas to the rest
* Discuss among the teammates which ones of all of them you like best
* When we come back together each tean presents their top concept
