## Brainstorm new product or service ideas

* We will break into random groups of 5
* Each member describes a product idea (see homework from week 2)
* Students discuss the products and try to answer these questions:
  * What "job" does the product do for the customer?
  * How big a pain does the product relieve?
  * Can the product or service make money?
  * Is there a way to reach these customers?
* Decide of these products you like best and prepare to describe it
