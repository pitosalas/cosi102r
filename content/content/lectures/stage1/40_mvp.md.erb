### Interesting but not required

* The term MVP was defined (for this specific context) several years ago by Eric Ries. It has always been a bit of a problem because people starting "misusing" it, to mean, "beta" or "early release". Another book i really like has their own refinement of the term: [What's an MVP?](http://ask.leanstack.com/lean-startup-fundamentals/what-is-a-minimum-viable-product-mvp)
* This [MVP Guide](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html) has a good video if you want to review things from a different angle. It's by Eric Ries himself.
* [How to start a startup](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec01/) (or watch the video, but if you do, don't miss the transcript comments). 
* [Minimum Viable PROTOTYPE!](https://www.toptal.com/designers/prototyping/minimum-viable-prototype)
