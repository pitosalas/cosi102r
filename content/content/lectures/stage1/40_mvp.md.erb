## Brainstorm!
* Every student will have to create at least one idea for a term project.
* As we brainstorm about product ideas you can start collecting the ones that you like and want to put forward as your idea for a term project.

<%= callout("Right now", " First round of brainstorming on possible term projects. Collect them on whiteboard and write them down. First all together, then in smaller groups. ") %>
