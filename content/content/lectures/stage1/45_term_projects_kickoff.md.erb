## Kicking off Term projects

* Ideas are cheap.
  * Whether you wrote up the idea or thought up the idea or love the idea, remember the idea is 0.1% of the journey.
  * The idea as written up is just a jumping off point. 
  * Based on the team and going out of the building, you will adjust it a little or a lot even.
* All team members come in equal. 
  * Everyone has to agree on how the team will be run.
  * I have not assigned a manager.
  * No special status if you think you "came up" with the idea, if you presented it, etc.
  * If the team wishes to nominate one (which is not a bad idea) do so at the second or maybe third meeting.
* Alignment
  * This is  very important concept.
  * I will harp on it a lot.
  * Work to the point where each team member would explain the product in the same way, as the same thing
  * This can only come through discussion, writing things down, being open to new ideas and flexible to adjust your ideas.
  * The only thing that makes an idea "the best" or "right" is what customers, users, people are willing to adopt.


## Review of Lean Startup Concepts (so far)
Bear with me. I am going to go through each one to reinforce, review and clarify.
