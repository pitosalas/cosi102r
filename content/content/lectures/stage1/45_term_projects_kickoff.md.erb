## MVP Review - and example

* What's an MVP
* Example: Going out of the building to talk to a shop owner
* What are your hypotheses?
* What do you think a shop owner asks themselves before adopting your product or service?
* Think about this for a little while, write some answers, then discuss your answers with your neighbor

## Kicking off Term projects
* Ideas are cheap.
    * Whether you wrote up the idea or thought up the idea or love the idea, remember the idea is 0.1% of the journey.
    * The idea as written up is just a jumping off point.
    * Based on the team and going out of the building, you will adjust it a little or a lot even.
* All team members have an equal voice
    * Everyone has to agree on how the team will be run.
    * I have not assigned a manager.
    * No special status if you think you "came up" with the idea, if you presented it, etc.
    * If the team wishes to nominate one (which is not a bad idea) do so at the second or maybe third meeting.
* Alignment
    * This is  very important concept.
    * I will harp on it a lot.
    * Work to the point where each team member would explain the product in the same way, as the same thing
    * This can only come through discussion, writing things down, being open to new ideas and flexible to adjust your ideas.
    * The only thing that makes an idea "the best" or "right" is what customers, users, people are willing to adopt.
