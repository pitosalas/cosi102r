##  Talk about Term Projects

* Between now and then we will be coming up with ideas, writing them up, etc.
* Here is a page with <%= link_to_topic :product_inspirations %>
* Discuss how it should work: <%= link_to_topic :cosi165a_term_project_outline %>

<slide_break></slide_break>
## Brainstorm!
* Every student will have to create at least one idea for a term project.
* As we brainstorm about product ideas you can start collecting the ones that you like and want to put forward as your idea for a term project.

<%= callout("Right now", " First round of brainstorming on possible term projects. Collect them on whiteboard and write them down. First all together, then in smaller groups. ") %>

## Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
