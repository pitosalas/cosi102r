* Teams please sit together

:topic_include :entrep_critical_thinking

:slide_bigtitle MVP Discussion

### Purpose

* Modeling how to conduct an out of the building MVP
* Also how to empathize with the potential user's perspectives

:slide_title Activity

* Take a moment to read and digest this idea :topic_link :bodega2
* Discuss it with your neighbor to make sure you understand it (as far as it goes)
* Come up with one or more MVPs
* What are some hypotheses that you could test with that?
* What do you think a shop owner asks themselves before adopting your product or service?
* Think about this for a little while, write some answers for yourself

:slide_title Alignment

* This is  very important concept. I will harp on it a lot.
* Work to the point where each team member would explain the product in the same way, as the same thing
* This can only come through discussion, writing things down, being open to new ideas and flexible to adjust your ideas.
* The only thing that makes an idea "the best" or "right" is what customers, users, people are willing to adopt.
* Whether you wrote up the idea or thought up the idea or love the idea, remember the idea is 0.1% of the journey.

:slide_title Discussions

* Review your top idea together and ensure alignment
* Review the :topic_link :hw_102_proj_stage1
* It will be due next week. Begin working on it.
