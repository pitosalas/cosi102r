<%= homework_hdr %>

1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Read:** "The Lean Startup", Chapters 1, 2 and 3. As you read please think about the following warmup questions:
    * Ries has a particular definition of a startup. What conditions must be true for him to consider a project within an established company to be a “startup”?
    * What kinds of uncertainty and risk does a startup encounter?
    * What was the crux of the original IMVU product vision?
    * What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!
    * <%= deliverable "Submit your answers to these warmup questions in Latte, as a pdf" %>. Warmup questions are always graded as "participation only" (<%= partbadge %>) in the form of a pdf, with your name and homework number in the header (<%= pdfbadge %>)

1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Read:** [Inventor who gave his idea away](http://www.techdirt.com/blog/innovation/articles/20130412/09091522689/heres-another-inventor-who-willingly-gave-his-greatest-idea-away-order-to-establish-it-as-global-standard.shtml) and [Students Inventing Programs to Streamline Their Colleges](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/nyregion/students-inventing-programs-to-streamline-their-colleges-data.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share&_r=0). <%= deliverable "Write a brief reflection, responding to one of these two articles -- thoughts, disagreements, reflections"  %>

## Key Takeaways
<%= toasty("Intro to Lean Startup (ch 1,2,3)",
    "Build-measure-Learn: Always iterate, learn from information you gather; apply the learnings and go again",
    "Validated Learning: Learning with empirical evidence in support of conclusions (learnings)",
    "Make sure you know who really needs what you are creating",
    "The question is not: \"Can this product be built\" but \"Should this product be built\" and \"Can we build a sustainable business around this product\"")
%>

## Homework Logistics

<%= callout("Student Quote", " \"Pay close attention to this. It's not complicated if you do. Still, almost everyone got it wrong the first few times.\" ") %>

* Yes there's a fair bit of homework. I do my best to make it obvious why the homework is useful in the context of what we are learning.
* You are responsible for reading the page for the days's lecture and locating the homeworks.
* Latte is used **just** as a way to submit homeworks
* Let's look at the mechanics of submitting homework: <%= link_to_topic :homework %>

<%= callout("remember", " Always Always submit them as pdfs!!! (unless its code, in which case as a .zip). Always Always! include your name and the homework number at the top of the page!") %>

## Discussion
* Let's talk about Paul Graham's Well concept
  * invert: x-axis people who want the product; y-axis how badly they want it
  * Google: Immense crater
  * Initial facebook: deep shallow well
  * Vertical vs. Horizontal products
  * Examples of highly horizontal products; examples of highly vertical products?
* Lets talk about Inventor who gave their idea away
  * What is Midi Standard?
  * What does Midi and Web have in common?
  * Heisenberg? Would charging for Web Standards have changed history?
  * I tell example of GIF format
* Let's talk about Student Built Apps
  * What is a central point of this article? (I see three)

    [//]: # (Users - the students -- always know better what they want and need. Ask them)
    [//]: # (Colleges should consider opening their APIs as this will unleash innovation)
    [//]: # (Students can have a real impact by creating applications)

## Pilot Project
* <%= link_to_topic :pilot_project %>
* Teams are determined. 5 students per. Term project will re-shuffle. Please sit together!
* Teams: have a discussion about the Pilot Project product concept
  * What do you want it to be?
  * Be ambitious (but not unrealistic). 
  * You may play with and or extend the idea. Pivots from basic vision are perfectly fine!
* Samples: <%= link_to_topic :hypothesis_types %>
