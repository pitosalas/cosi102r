<%= callout("Continue to work on Stage 2", "It is due on November 14. Decide on and do more out of the building testing: survey, 1-1 interview, landing page, anything else you can think of. Make sure you know and indicate what the hypotheses were that you were testing as well as the methodology and results of the test. Record your work and the results. Remember we are looking for non-trivial amount of outside testing. Also go back and revise the sections that you are bringing over from Stage 1; depending on your pivot it might have to be fully rewritten.") %>

## 1. Read and Respond to Principles of UI Design <%= partbadge %>

* Read [this article about about principles for a clean visual design](http://www.visualmess.com) Select two of the principles and find two examples of web sites or mobile apps that VIOLATE those principles. Write a 1 page paper with images, explaining the two principles in your own words, showing the examples that you found, and explaining why they violated the principles.

## 2. Sketch two screens <%= pdfbadge %>

* **Note, this is an individual not a team assignment!** Read a second article to inspire you on how to create cheap sketches and mockups: [Everything you need to know about UX Sketching](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/guide-to-ux-sketching?utm_campaign=blog_post_guide_to_ux_sketching&utm_medium=email&utm_source=blog_subscribers). Now, design and sketches of the two most important screens in your app. If your product has NO screens, then you can provide a sketch, drawing, or video of whatever it is. Try to map the ideas of good UI design onto your product as well as you can. Work independently to see how different ideas come out. Try to use some of the principles from the articles above. You may use any tool(s) you want - pencil and paper, watercolors, photoshop, but really I recommend www.balsamiq.com. It is important that you work neatly and clearly so we can appreciate your ideas. I will be looking specifically to see that you thought about hierarchy, placement, sizes, alignment, balance and so on. 
* <%= deliverable "Post a pdf containing the two images, and your commentary.  We will review them together in class" %>

## 3. Read Several Articles and propose MVPs

* [Growing Convertkit to $5,020 in Monthly Recurring Revenue](http://nathanbarry.com/5k/).
* [Experiment Examples to Get You Started Testing your Idea](https://firm.builders/experiment-examples-to-get-you-started-to-test-your-idea-6c0a3690c702#.ag6a9p1s1)
* [Idea to Paying Customers in 7 Weeks: How We Did It](https://blog.bufferapp.com/idea-to-paying-customers-in-7-weeks-how-we-did-it)

* This is an individual assignment. Based on this reading, write up one or two original ideas for MVPs that you think would be really effective for your product. Preferably not a google form. Write it up in a way that you could acually implement it over the coming weekend. Make sure you tie it to a hypothesis that you and your team have prioritized. <%= deliverable "Brief writeup of your proposed MVP as a pdf submitted to Latte" %>
