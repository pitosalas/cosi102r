# Homeworks for this week

## 1. Read Chapter 7 of "Lean Startup". <%= partbadge %>

This chapter begins the justification and explanation of the importance of measurement. Here are some warmup questions:

* The chapter talks a lot about "the engine of growth". Explain the concept in one paragraph so that someone who is not familiar with Lean Startup could understand it.
* What is Lazy Registration? Describe the reason why Grockit implemented it originally, how they tested its effectiveness and what they concluded about Lazy Registration at Grockit.
* Thinking about your pilot project, what would an example be of a "vanity" metric and what of an "actionable" metric? In what way is that  vanity metric?
* Checkin: What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!
* <%= deliverable "Write your responses to these as a post in the participation blog" %>


## 2 Sharktank! <%= partbadge %> 

Watch one episode of ["Shark Tank"](http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank), a TV show about fake venture capitalists. As you watch it, think of these questions:

* What did you see that you had never seen before?
* How did it make you feel?
* What could you learn from this?
* How real or fake do you think this was?
* <%= deliverable "Write your responses to these as a post in the participation blog. Include when you watched it, who else was watching, and what the episode was." %>

## Read "The Lean Startup", Chapter 8. <%= partbadge %>

This chapter is about pivoting (or not!) Please answer the following warmup questions:

* Often the term "runway" is used in startup financing to refer to how many months there are to go before the money runs out. Eric Ries says "A startup's runway is the number of pivots it can still make." What is he trying to get at? Is there a real difference in his statement? What is he reminding us of?
* If several of your hypotheses are invalidated through experiments, does that mean that you have to Pivot? Explain.
* What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!
