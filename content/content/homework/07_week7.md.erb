<%= callout("Continue to work on Stage 2", "It is due on November 2. Decide on and do more out of the building testing: survey, 1-1 interview, landing page, anything else you can think of. Make sure you know and indicate what the hypotheses were that you were testing as well as the methodology and results of the test. Record your work and the results. Remember we are looking for non-trivial amount of outside testing. Also go back and revise the sections that you are bringing over from Stage 1; depending on your pivot it might have to be fully rewritten.") %>
