<%= callout("Continue to work on Stage 2", "It is due on November 2. Decide on and do more out of the building testing: survey, 1-1 interview, landing page, anything else you can think of. Make sure you know and indicate what the hypotheses were that you were testing as well as the methodology and results of the test. Record your work and the results. Remember we are looking for non-trivial amount of outside testing. Also go back and revise the sections that you are bringing over from Stage 1; depending on your pivot it might have to be fully rewritten.") %>

## 1. 3-5 minute video <%= teambadge %>

### Purpose

* You have been working hard on your individual projects and spoken at length mostly with your teammmates and your TA partner.

### Activity

* Create a 3-5 minute video explaining your product
* Use at most 3 slides, and definitely include members of the team in the video
* You don't have to have fancy production values, titles, fades, or anything else, unless you want
* The quality is kind of like the ones that I do for the class
* It doesn't have to be serious - Feel free to make it funny - try to make it engaging

### What to include in the video

* Name of the product and the teammates
* A brief summary of what the product is.
* Remember, the listener has never heard this before.
* Keep it simple, start at the beginning, and make it as clear as you can
* What is the biggest pai that it resolves
* Who is it for, and how do you know they want it
* What your current status is: quickly what MVPs, or tests you've done and plan to do
* Concluding statement
