**Read:** "The Lean Startup", Chapters 1, 2 and 3. As you read please think about the following warmup questions:

* What kinds of uncertainty and risk does a startup encounter?
* What was the crux of the original IMVU product vision?
* What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!
