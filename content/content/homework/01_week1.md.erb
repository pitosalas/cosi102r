## 1. Paul Graham Paper

### Purpose

Coming up with an entrepreneurial idea or noticing one when it comes your way, doesn't have to be random. These articles will teach you some perspectives on how to improve the odds that your project will be successful.

**Read article** by Paul Graham about [How to get startup ideas](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html) and ["You can't teach entrepreneurship"](http://www.forbes.com/sites/babson/2012/05/24/you-cant-teach-entrepreneurship/) 

<%= deliverable "Write a brief reflection on these articles. Focus on what some points that are made that you didn't understand or agree with; and some that you think are excellent and meaningful. Explain what he means by the 'schlep factor'. Be subtle. one page max. Post as a pdf to Latte" %>

## 2. Read Lean Startup Chapters 1, 2 and 3<%= partbadge %>

**Read:** "The Lean Startup", Chapters 1, 2 and 3. As you read please think about the following warmup questions:

* Ries has a particular definition of a startup. What conditions must be true for him to consider a project within an established company to be a “startup”?
* What kinds of uncertainty and risk does a startup encounter?
* What was the crux of the original IMVU product vision?
* What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!

<%= deliverable "Write your responses to these as a post in the participation blog" %>

## 3. Generate 3 Product ideas

### Purpose

* Expose you to numerous sources of product ideas
* Try to begin applying some of the ideas from the readings so far
* Get in the practice of critically thinking and challenging your business ideas
* Force you to examine your ideas through a more formal lens

### Do This

* Look for inspiration for a product or business idea
* Here are a set of resources to start with: <%= link_to_topic :product_inspirations %>
* Spend at least 1 hour and select three promising ideas
* You will not be required to work on any of them
* I will ask that you share them with the rest of the class
* Look for real problems or pains that exist in the world that your product could address.
* Look problems that are severe and not just inconveniences
* As yourself what  "job" the product will do for the customer, and who that customer might be.
* Write up three product descriptions, including a product name, a tweet-length description, a longer description, a summary of the target customer, what the pain is that your product will solve.
