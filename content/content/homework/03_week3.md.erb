## 1. Read The Lean Startup Chapter 6 <%= partbadge %>

### Think about the following warmup questions about Chapter 6

* Sometimes customers get a product that's imperfect, incomplete. When might this happen? . Is that a good or bad thing? What's the purpose for doing this?
* It's been said (by me among others) that an MVP is neither minimum, viable nor a product. Can you explain why that might be a valid statement, or not?
* How can you do an MVP of a hardware product? After all, a hardware product by definition has to be manufactured and that is never cheap.
* What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!

## 2. Read Chapter 7 of "Lean Startup". <%= partbadge %>

This chapter begins the justification and explanation of the importance of measurement. Here are some warmup questions:

* The chapter talks a lot about "the engine of growth". Explain the concept in one paragraph so that someone who is not familiar with Lean Startup could understand it.
* What is Lazy Registration? Describe the reason why Grockit implemented it originally, how they tested its effectiveness and what they concluded about Lazy Registration at Grockit.
* Thinking about your pilot project, what would an example be of a "vanity" metric and what of an "actionable" metric? In what way is that  vanity metric?
* Checkin: What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!

## 3. Read "The Lean Startup", Chapter 8. <%= partbadge %>

This chapter is about pivoting (or not!) Please answer the following warmup questions:

* Often the term "runway" is used in startup financing to refer to how many months there are to go before the money runs out. Eric Ries says "A startup's runway is the number of pivots it can still make." What is he trying to get at? Is there a real difference in his statement? What is he reminding us of?
* If several of your hypotheses are invalidated through experiments, does that mean that you have to Pivot? Explain.
* What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!

## 4. Team Alignment <%= teambadge %>

Meet for at least 2 hours, face to face with your team and come up with your team's product vision with the following elements. Notice that for this exercise it is necessary to discuss each point in the team meeeting and articulate your answer in a fairly precise way that you all can accept. I realize that they are so far not tested; you will be able to improve and amend them in the coming days and weeks. The important thing at this point is that all team members engage and understand and agree with the vision as of now.

* **Product Vision**: Your current vision of the product. Make it descriptive, not salesy. Remember the reader is not inside your head they will need to have it explained.
* **Problems that it solves**: Continue your explanation by explicitly stating the list of 1 or 2 or 3 real world user problems that it solves. Make it pass the common sense tests. These should not be tiny silly problems but should be recognizable by the target users. Distinguish between problems you solve and pains you remove.
* **Who is/are the customer/s**: Describe groups of users or customers in a way that keeps in mind how you might reach them. If your customers are "Higher Ed Students who are having trouble finishing their homework on time". How would you find them to talk to them and dig deeper? Also remember that your vision might include two disjoint sets of users or customers.
