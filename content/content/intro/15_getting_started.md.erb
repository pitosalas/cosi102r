## Hello and Welcome to Software Entrepreneurship!

This summer I put a lot of time and thought into revamping it to improve and adapt it to our new "situation". There are many resources available and I've done my very best to make it clear and understandable and as simple as possible to follow! So, let's go!

### Before we begin, I have a few tasks for you to complete.

1. Review the syllabus and resource repository.

I have assembled some important documents and resources for you in one central place. You'll find a direct link to the course textbook, assignment rubrics, instructions for the major assignments in the Course Resources section. All of these materials are also linked throughout the course when we'll be using them.

2. Find out where to get help

Navigate to the Communications Center section to get familiar with the various avenues for help available to you in this course and throughout your program. For technology help, including help with LATTE, contact the Technology Help Desk at the links or phone number in the LATTE Resources block on the left side of the page. In this same block, you will find links to Library Resources, as well, such as OneSearch and Find Your Librarian.

## Course Announcements and Feedback

The Course Announcements forum is where I send out messages to the whole class that will arrive in your Brandeis inbox. This is the only place where I will give announcements. I will not send separate emails. It is your responsibility to read and stay abreast of these. These announcements begin with a welcome to the class and will include reminders about upcoming activities or relevant information and insights about the week's topics. You can read the course announcements in the forum below.
