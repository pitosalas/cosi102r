## Hello and Welcome to Software Entrepreneurship!

* Course totally updated due to pandemic and size of class!
* Let's take a quick look at how to get started!

    This summer I put a lot of time and thought into revamping it to improve and adapt it to our new "situation". There are many resources available and I've done my very best to make it clear and understandable and as simple as possible to follow! So, let's go!

* **IMPORTANT**:Please take a moment RIGHT NOW to answer this ["About Me" Survey](https://forms.gle/7YAjDG2ttXSEEbt17)

### Ask the Professor (Private Forum)

* Use the Ask the Professor private forum to contact me directly.
* This is a private forum, so only you and I will see our conversation.

    You can reach out to me directly within LATTE in your Ask the Professor forum. I'm happy to answer any questions you have related to the course material. If you are struggling to complete an assignment, need some clarity on an idea we're reviewing, or just want to talk about any aspect of the course, please reach out. 

* Some common concerns you might write to me with include:
    * I'm having trouble with a team member who is not completing their work on time. Can you provide some guidance?
    * I'd like to understand why I received the grade I did on my paper. Can we schedule a time to talk about how I can improve in the future?

### Participation Blog

* Throughout the semester there will be many "participation" assignments
* Asking for a reflection or response in the "participation blog"
* I will post a question here from time to time and expect every student to respond to it according to the directions given. 
* Your contributions to this forum over the whole semester will be an important part of your participation grade.

## Communications

* **Course Announcement Forum ONLY** The [Course Announcements Forum](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=1120944) is where I send out messages to the whole class. You will receive a  notification from Latte. This is the only place where I will give announcements. I will not send separate emails.

* It is your responsibility to read and stay abreast of these. These announcements begin with a welcome to the class and will include reminders about upcoming activities or relevant information and insights about the week's topics. You can read the course announcements in the forum below.

* **Response Expectations**: When we communicate to each other - a question, or request, I expect a response within 24 hours. Even if the response is "no thanks". This is part of the professional startup environment we are trying to create.
