# 2020 Cosi102a Feedbacks

## End of Semester Feedback Summary

### Hits

* The feedback is overwhelmingly positive. Still there are ways to improve it
* The TAs were great. The weekly TA meetings were mostly (but not always) very worthwhile
* Guest speakers very well received; people loved hearing from them
* In general people liked the Lean Startup Book
* The intellectual property and financial plan lectures were favorites
* In general people were positive about the team projects

### Misses

* There was too much lecturing. The lectures could be boring.
* Make it more clear that this course is about starting a software business and not "computer science" per se
* And consistent with that, have more breakout room exercises
* Have a venue where groups present to each other so they know more about what everyone else is doing

## Your feedback on Post-it Notes

### You liked: 

* Energetic Lectures
* Very interesting, even readings, although they are a bit long
* You're doing great
* Lean Startup is a good book

### Room for improvement

* **Case Studies**: You would like more more case studies (6) and guest speakers (5) (e.g. real startups)

* **Book:** You like the book but some people feel there is too much book discussion (3), too many reading assignments (3); but on the other hands some of you want more book discussion (3) and more class discussions in general (3), but you dont like the cold calling (2)
* **Lecturing**: You would like less lecturing (2) and instead have more hands-on activities in class (6)
* **Group work:** Some people want more group work in class (2) or less group work in class (2)
* **Projects**: You would like more talk about projects in class, about how to do an mvp (2), how to be effective in a team, and you wish you had more guidance on the pilot projects.

### Actions

* I will try to have less lecturing and more in class activities
* You just had several guest speakers in a row, more are coming
* I am thinking of starting each class with a short discussion about a product, or product idea, or one of the term projects, what do you think?
