<%= homework_hdr %>

1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Read:** Read Chapter 7 of "Lean Startup". This chapter begins the justification and explanation of the importance of measurement. Here are some warmup questions:
    * The chapter talks a lot about "the engine of growth". Explain the concept in one paragraph so that someone who is not familiar with Lean Startup could understand it.
    * What is Lazy Registration? Describe the reason why Grockit implemented it originally, how they tested its effectiveness and what they concluded about Lazy Registration at Grockit.
    * Thinking about your pilot project, what would an example be of a "vanity" metric and what of an "actionable" metric? In what way is that  vanity metric?
    * Checkin: What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!
    * <%= deliverable "Write a short document with your responses, as a pdf" %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Shark Tank:** Watch 1 episode of ["Shark Tank"](http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank), a TV show about fake venture capitalists. <%= deliverable "Submit some reactions and reflections. How did the show make you feel? What surprised you? Did it change your mind?" %>
1. **Read:** Read and come with questions about how the term projects will work: <%= link_to_section :term, :term_project_outline %> and <%= link_to_topic :cosi165a_final_deliverables %>

## Kicking off Term projects

* Ideas are cheap.
  * Whether you wrote up the idea or thought up the idea or love the idea, remember the idea is 0.1% of the journey.
  * The idea as written up is just a jumping off point. 
  * Based on the team and going out of the building, you will adjust it a little or a lot even.
* All team members come in equal. 
  * Everyone has to agree on how the team will be run.
  * I have not assigned a manager.
  * No special status if you think you "came up" with the idea, if you presented it, etc.
  * If the team wishes to nominate one (which is not a bad idea) do so at the second or maybe third meeting.
* Alignment
  * This is  very important concept.
  * I will harp on it a lot.
  * Work to the point where each team member would explain the product in the same way, as the same thing
  * This can only come through discussion, writing things down, being open to new ideas and flexible to adjust your ideas.
  * The only thing that makes an idea "the best" or "right" is what customers, users, people are willing to adopt.


## Review of Lean Startup Concepts (so far)
Bear with me. I am going to go through each one to reinforce, review and clarify.
