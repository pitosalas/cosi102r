1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Read:** "The Lean Startup", Chapter 10. This chapter is all about achieving sustainable growth. Please answer the following warmup questions:
    * Can you distinguish sustainable growth from unsustainable growth? Come up with a specific example to demonstrate your explanation.
    * The chapter talks about the cost of customer acquisition. What does that mean, and give some examples of different customer acquisition tactics and what their costs might relate to.
    * What is the viral coefficient? Use an example NOT in the chapter.
    * What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!
    * <%= deliverable "Submit your answers to these questions in a pdf to latte" %>.

### Continuing work

* **Continue to work on Stage 2**: Will be due on November 14. Decide on and do more out of the building testing: survey, 1-1 interview, landing page, anything else you can think of. Make sure you know and indicate what the hypotheses were that you were testing as well as the methodology and results of the test. Record your work and the results. Remember we are looking for non-trivial amount of outside testing. You will need it for your term report.

## Your feedback on Post-it Notes

### You liked: 
* Energetic Lectures
* Very interesting, even readings, although they are a bit long
* Youre doing great
* Lean Startup is a good book

### Room for improvement
* **Case Studies**: You would like more more case studies (6) and guest speakers (5) (e.g. real startups)
* **Book:** You like the book but some people feel there is too much book discussion (3), too many reading assignments (3); but on the other hands some of you want more book discussion (3) and more class discussions in general (3), but you dont like the cold calling (2)
* **Lecturing**: You would like less lecturing (2) and instead have more hands-on activities in class (6)
* **Group work:** Some people want more group work in class (2) or less group work in class (2)
* **Projects**: You would like more talk about projects in class, about how to do an mvp (2), how to be effective in a team, and you wish you had more guidance on the pilot projects.

### Actions
* I will try to have less lecturing and more in class activities
* You just had several guest speakers in a row, more are coming
* I am thinking of starting each class with a short discussion about a product, or product idea, or one of the term projects, what do you think?
