<%= homework_hdr %>

1.  <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Read**:Lean Startup Chapter 4 and 5. Please consider the following warmup questions, and write up your responses.
    * Explain what a concierge MVP is and how it is used
    * What does Eric Ries mean by "getting out of the building"? What message is he trying to get across? What mistake is he trying to teach you to avoid?
    * What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!
    * <%= deliverable "Submit warmup questions in Latte" %> as a pdf.
1.  <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Pilot Teams**: Meet outside of class TWO TIMES for at least 1 hour each, and discuss the project, and **begin** drafting their Pilot Project Report (see <%= link_to_topic  :pilot_project %>). Do this as a shared Google doc. Make that document publically available. Update Latte Page "Pilot Project Teams and Reports Link Page" with the names of the pilot team members, and a link to the draft of your report. <%= team_deliverable "Your draft pilot project report as a pdf with the team members names listed." %>

### Interesting but not required
* ["Why do research when you can fail fast and pivot?"](http://www.wired.com/2013/09/why-do-research-when-you-can-fail-fast-pivot-and-act-out-other-popular-startup-cliches/)
* [Build Measure learn vs. Learn Measure Build](http://grasshopperherder.com/build-measure-learn-vs-learn-measure-build/) and [Getting Out of the Office is Product Management](https://overcast.fm/+EUuWJyStE)

## Discussion
* Thanks for warmups, they are excellent!
* Please sit in groups of Pilot Project teams so you can talk to each other.

## Hypotheses

<%= include_topic :entrepreneur_four_questions %>

## Pilot Project Teams Questions: Work in groups
1. What is an **MVP**? What different types of MVP can you think up? What might some MVPs be for our pilot project? Which one would you create first? Why?
1. What is a **concierge MVP**? Coulld you apply that idea to our pilot project? How? And would that have any benefits?
1. What is the role of **hypotheses** within the lean startup model? What are some different kinds or examples of hypotheses that you can come up with for our pilot project? How positive do you feel about whether our pilot project would be successful? How do you explain that it is already successful in India?
1. What is the **Value Hypothesis**, specifically? Why is it important? What are some possible value hypotheses for our pilot project? How could you test them?
1. What is a **Growth Hypothesis**, specifically? Why is it important? What are some possible Growth hypotheses for our pilot project? How could you test them?
1. What is a **leap of faith hypothesis?** Do all products have a leap of faith hypothesis? Does our pilot project have a leap of faith hypothesis?
1. What are some of the ways to **validate hypotheses**? What are some ways to validate them for our pilot project? What are some specific experiments?
1. What does RIES mean by **"getting out of the building?"** Why is this super important? For our pilot project give some specific concepts for getting out of the building that you could implement.
1. What is the **engine of growth?** Can there be more than one engine of growth? Does it stay constant from the start? What are some ideas for our pilot project's engine(s? 
1. Why would products with high **network effects** also often have a high switching cost? Would our pilot project have high switching costs? Could you figure out way to give it high switching costs?
1. It's not whether we can build a product, it's whether we SHOULD build the product. How can you avoid building a product nobody wants? How can you apply this to our pilot project?
1. **Competition** and competitive analysis is still important. Who would the competion be for our pilot project? Does it have any? Is it a natural extension of something that already exists or do you think it's a brand new niche that will grow on its own? What else about competition?
