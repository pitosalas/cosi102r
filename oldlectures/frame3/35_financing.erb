### Interesting, but not required reading
* [Venture Capital Algebra](https://www.feld.com/archives/2004/07/venture-capital-deal-algebra.html) - The different calculations that come to play when getting investments from Venture Capitalists and Angels. I’ve found that even sophisticated entrepreneurs didn’t necessary grasp how valuation math (or “deal algebra”) works
* [Valuation](https://avc.com/2004/07/valuation/) - the concept of valuation is often misunderstood by the people engaged in this process. And it’s particularly true in early stage investing.
