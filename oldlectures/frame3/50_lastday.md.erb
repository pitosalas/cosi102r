* **Final deliverables are due at 11:59** of the last day of class, TODAY!
    * I realize that the presentation slides might need to change as you practice, so they may be resubmitted if you want to. The deadline for resubmission is midnight the day before presentation day.
    * Remember your <%= link_to_topic :cosi165a_final_deliverables %>!
