1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Principles of UI Design**: Read [this article about about principles for a clean visual design](http://www.visualmess.com) Select two of the principles and find two examples of web sites or mobile apps that VIOLATE those principles. Write a 1 page paper with images, explaining the two principles in your own words, showing the examples that you found, and explaining why they violated the principles. <%= deliverable "Submit to Latte, as pdf" %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Two Screens of your App**: **Note, this is an individual not a team assignment!** Read a second article to inspire you on how to create cheap sketches and mockups: [Everything you need to know about UX Sketching](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/guide-to-ux-sketching?utm_campaign=blog_post_guide_to_ux_sketching&utm_medium=email&utm_source=blog_subscribers). Now, design and sketches of the two most important screens in your app. If your product has NO screens, then you can provide a sketch, drawing, or video of whatever it is. Try to map the ideas of good UI design onto your product as well as you can. Work independently to see how different ideas come out. Try to use some of the principles from the articles above. You may use any tool(s) you want - pencil and paper, watercolors, photoshop, but really I recommend www.balsamiq.com. It is important that you work neatly and clearly so we can appreciate your ideas. I will be looking specifically to see that you thought about hierarchy, placement, sizes, alignment, balance and so on. <%= deliverable "Post a pdf containing the two images, and your commentary.  We will review them together in class" %>

### Ongoing work
* **Continue to work on Stage 2**: Will be due on November 14. Decide on and do more out of the building testing: survey, 1-1 interview, landing page, anything else you can think of. Make sure you know and indicate what the hypotheses were that you were testing as well as the methodology and results of the test. Record your work and the results. Remember we are looking for non-trivial amount of outside testing. You will need it for your term report.

## Discussion
* Stage 2 deliverable date
* Presentation Coaching. Each team for 45 minutes: https://calendly.com/pitosalas/bill
* How many MVPs
* In class activities
* Review: Hypotheses
  * Don't need one from each category
  * Go for quality not quantity
  * Its not a hypothesis if you don't know exactly how to test it
* Review: Landing page as MVP
  * Why is it called a landing page?
  * What is the hypothesis?
  * How will you get people to see it?
  * How will you determine if the hypothesis is borne out?
* Volunteers show off their two screen samples and we discuss and give feedback.

## Conclusion

* I want you to always refer back to principles such as these when you design or present a user experience.
* It's very easy to say, "Oh it's common sense." But you submit designs that violate these principles left and right.
* It's important. Make it part of your toolkit. Internalize it! Take care!

## Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
