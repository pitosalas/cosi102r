1. <%= teambadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Teams**: Develop and test a landing page. This is a team deliverable. Make sure you tie it to a real hypothesis. Be specific in the audience to whom you are presenting it so you can make sense of what it's telling you. Try to get it out there to get some responses to it. This is also one of the deliverables for Stage 2 of <%= link_to_topic :cosi165a_term_project_outline %>. Here are lots of more tips on how to proceed: <%= link_to_topic :landing_page %>. <%= team_deliverable "Brief report on process and results. Include url to the actual page." %>
1. <%= teambadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Teams**: Look at: [Five Second Test](http://fivesecondtest.com) and choose an aspect of your product to test using this site. It can be a paper mockup, a product name, a tag line, or anything else. <%= team_deliverable "post of what you tested and what the result was. Include a link to the site or a screen capture of the result." %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Read** The following articles:
    * [Growing Convertkit to $5,020 in Monthly Recurring Revenue](http://nathanbarry.com/5k/).
    * [Experiment Examples to Get You Started Testing your Idea](https://firm.builders/experiment-examples-to-get-you-started-to-test-your-idea-6c0a3690c702#.ag6a9p1s1)
    * [Idea to Paying Customers in 7 Weeks: How We Did It](https://blog.bufferapp.com/idea-to-paying-customers-in-7-weeks-how-we-did-it)
    * This is an individual assignment. Based on this reading, write up one or two original ideas for MVPs that you think would be really effective for your product. Preferably not a google form. Write it up in a way that you could acually implement it over the coming weekend. Make sure you tie it to a hypothesis that you and your team have prioritized. <%= deliverable "Brief writeup of your proposed MVP as a pdf submitted to Latte" %>

## Continuing work
* **Continue to work on Stage 2**: Will be due on November 14. Decide on and do more out of the building testing: survey, 1-1 interview, landing page, anything else you can think of. Make sure you know and indicate what the hypotheses were that you were testing as well as the methodology and results of the test. Record your work and the results. Remember we are looking for non-trivial amount of outside testing. You will need it for your term report.

## Project Feedback

* What are we stuck or stumped with right now?
