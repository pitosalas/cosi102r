### How to improve the 2017 edition of the course

* Have some kind of social introduction cocktail party section early on.
* Just 30 minutes of mingling. Give them specific things to find out about each other
* Work hard to have an interactive section in every lecture
* Having the lemonade stand exercise followed by the teams discussing their pricing models worked well
* Make sure the TA partners are assigned early on and that they know they have to check in weekly with their teams.

### Positioning

* Exactly what is lean startup
* Kind of a hackathon/case cometition that goes a whole semester
* Does not require Cosi
* Officially cross referenced with Business

### add pre- and post- survey + essay
* Write a paragraph or two about your own views of yourself as an entrepreneur or someone who really wants to start their own company or someone who loves being part of something bigger, an established company with a huge impact on the world. Do you feel that would be exciting or too risky? Could you see it either way or do you have a clear vision in one direction or the other? Do you feel you have a sense that you know it takes to be an entrepreneur?
